  <h4 class="cases__h4">INTRODUCTION</h4>
    <p>This case study outlines the work I contributed to multiple product features and design system components for <strong>OneFootball app</strong>. My focus was on creating engaging user experiences, developing new features, and integrating them with our design system to ensure consistency and scalability.</p>
  <h4 class="cases__h4">PROBLEM</h4>
    <p>As <strong>OneFootball</strong> expanded its offerings, the app required new features to drive user engagement, improve retention, and enhance monetization. At the same time, maintaining design consistency across these new features was a challenge due to the growing complexity of the platform.</p>
  <h4 class="cases__h4">SOLUTION</h4>
    <p>I contributed to developing key features like <strong>a Loyalty Program, MatchXP, and a Marketplace</strong>, while ensuring the integration of new components into our <strong>design system (DS)</strong>. This approach not only improved the user experience but also aligned with the scalability and design consistency goals of the app.</p>
